# Today I Learned

Write **1–3 concrete things** you understood better today.

- What _clicked_ today?
  - using coding we can create complex designed that look simple but need a
    clear understand of logic and math that help us to shape our imagination.
- What changed in your understanding?
  - In setinterval i just create a simple moving object and very basic animation
    the day mentor taught us he show a magic with just simple setInteval but
    today he again he show some moving rocket visulaization.
- What would you explain differently now?
  - Knowing only logic not make such type of good animation we have to keep real
    life physics and math in our to make it more cooler.

# Still Confusing

List **up to 3 things** that are still unclear.

- What almost makes sense but doesn’t fully?
  - serialization of promise ,Today i worked on recipe but stuck to create
    serialization taks at last i find out.
- What would you like to see one more example of?
  - complex example of promise to track the sequence.
- What feels fragile in your understanding?
  - await with readtextfile in async function.

# Questions to Chase

Write **2–5 questions** worth pursuing later.

Rules:

- Questions must be specific
- Avoid yes/no questions

- “Why does X behave differently when Y?”
  - why does await behave differently when it is in async function.
- “What breaks if I remove Z?”
  - What happen when i use await Promise.resolve()
- “How does this scale / fail / degrade?”
  - How async and await made some different in sequence of execuation

# Tiny Experiments (Optional)

Small things you want to try tomorrow or later.

- Loops and If else in terminal , notification
- A REPL experiment
- A minimal snippet(like arrow function with ${1...})
- A variation of today’s code
- simple code for better understanding of shifting of origin.

> math.
