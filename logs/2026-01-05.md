# Today I Learned

Write **1–3 concrete things** you understood better today.

- What _clicked_ today?
  - perlin noise and chunk which are stream enqueued which provide a feature for
    example if i want to stream a video it help that no need to wait untill the
    full is loaded it run till chunk is read(i am not that much sure about it
    but i will read more about it)
- What changed in your understanding?
- this is about perlin noise ,so the perlin noise is a pseudorandom whose value
  is dependent on the other value surrounded by it, and the crazy part is it use
  to create terrain.
- What would you explain differently now?
- So,perlin noise is constant for a value provided seeding is same so to get
  soomth noise we have to change the value or argument by dx while provinding a
  large delta we get nearly random numbers.

# Still Confusing

List **up to 3 things** that are still unclear.

- What almost makes sense but doesn’t fully?
- formation of 2d perlin noise.
- What would you like to see one more example of?
- 1d perlin noise.
- What feels fragile in your understanding?
- Readable and writeable stream

# Questions to Chase

Write **2–5 questions** worth pursuing later.

Rules:

- Questions must be specific
- Avoid yes/no questions

- “Why does X behave differently when Y?”
- why does perlin noise behave differently when dx is large?
- what is the difference between perlin and value noise?
- what is the actual use of dot product of vector i know the formulas but it
  seem very odd that i don't know the actual use of it.
- “What breaks if I remove Z?”
- “How does this scale / fail / degrade?”

# Tiny Experiments (Optional)

Small things you want to try tomorrow or later.

- Readable stream and writeable steam

# One-Sentence Summary

Finish this sentence:

> Today was useful because ** I know another method to take input**.
